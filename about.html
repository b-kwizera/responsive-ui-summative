      <h2 id="how-heading">How It SUPPOSEDLY Works</h2>
      <div class="how-it-works">
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Add Your Transactions:</strong> Fill in the description, amount, category, and date for each expense or income.</li>

          <li><strong>Search & Filter:</strong> Use regex patterns to search through your records. For example, <code>^Food</code> finds all entries starting with "Food".</li>
          <li><strong>Export Your Data:</strong> Download your records as a JSON file anytime for backup or analysis in other tools.</li>
